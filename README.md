# AISF

**Overview:**

With all that is happening in AI, there are some things that are reported in the news, and there are many things that are happening IRL that are not. San Francisco is abuzz again with a new tech renaissance and people often have fomo for missing out on the many talks and events that are taking place. Organizations often say ‘recording will be available for those who missed’ but who really watches those? And where are they hosted/posted anyway? 

The AISF news page creates AI generated articles based on the transcription of videos from IRL AI events in SF. Missed that Andrew Chen talk? Here’s a summary. You can also click to watch the full thing if you want. Read an interesting quote in the article? Here’s the exact timestamp of where you can find that in the video if you watch it.

There’s much happening in AI right now IRL that reading the news or scrolling through twitter is not that effective for truly understanding what’s being said. AISF News solves that, all in one place. 

We can also expand beyond IRL events in san francisco and ingest any relevant youtube video and generate articles about it. The page could be expanded to other verticals in the tech industry.

AISF was originally created for the weeklong event that we hosted at founders, inc. We have hundreds of people engaged that we would like to continue to nurture. Our plan was to make AISF the largest IRL tech community in SF. We can still do this and are planning on it. In the website sketch below the page is somewhat split with IRL events on the bottom and a news page on the top that can be expanded.

When you click any thumbnail, it should take you to a page with a header image and the full article just like any regular news site would. However, any relevant quotes would be timestamped based on the video and there would be a link to the full video following the article.

We will start creating articles based on all of our own videos and events and quickly expand to report on a bunch of different organizations and the events they are hosting. We have a relationship with a16z and they record their events. We’ll ask them for a link to their videos, ingest them, and post articles.

Underneath this is the goal to create a media site that we can drive traffic and get reach, while pushing founders, inc. relevant content to the top.
